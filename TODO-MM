  o \keyword{.} in man/*.Rd should be better and consistent

  o use \link{} better; clean up several \details{} which repeat themselves
	{partly done, by collapsing some man pages}

  o Fix bug of (un)pack8bit():

   > all(250:255 == unpack8bit(pack8bit(250:255)))
   [1] FALSE
   Warning message:
   longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
    in: 250:255 == unpack8bit(pack8bit(250:255))

  o R CMD check --use-valgrind wavethresh
		^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    still indicates unsolved problems in C !
