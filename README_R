This version is intended as an add-on package for R.
It is installed as described in R's  help(library) or Kurt Hornik's R-FAQ:

Untar the add-on package (in $RHOME/src/library or another place where you
			  keep add-on packages)
and type

      R INSTALL wavethresh
or
      R INSTALL -l <lib.loc> wavethresh

at the shell prompt.

New (Oct 1999):

  C-code in ./src :
		Change to ANSI C prototypes, using wavelet.h;
		no "-Wall" warnings anymore

  R/ : Cleanup  (last.dump; obj.files)
	persp() and image() plots *are* available
	Slight improvements to print.*, plot.wd, ...
	New functions pack8bit and unpack8bit

  data/ : Use packed version of Lennon's face.

  man/
      Cleaned up missing links; now workable
      Examples are executable

  Finally,
  	    R CMD check -l ... wavethresh
	    -----------        ----------
  works (producing a wavethresh-Examples.ps file of ~ 52 MB !)


TODO:
      o \keyword{.} in man/*.Rd should be better and consistent
      o use \link{} better; clean up several \details{} which repeat themselves
