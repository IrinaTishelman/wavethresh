Welcome to wavelets for S and Splus
-----------------------------------

Setting up the software
-----------------------

1. Create a subdirectory to contain all the software

% mkdir WAVELET
% cd WAVELET

2. Unpack the Shell archive

% sh wavethresh2.2

3. This creates a subdirectory called "DISTRIB2.2", enter this directory:

% cd DISTRIB2.2

4. Set up the software by typing:

% make all 
<set up messages>
%

5. Clean up by typing:

% make cleanobj 


Using the software
------------------

Assumptions: the wavelet software is
	     in directory "/home/fred/WAVELET/DISTRIB2.2/.Data"

1. Start-up S anywhere (/home/fred/WAVELET/DISTRIB2.2 NOT recommended)

% S
>

2. Attach the wavelet software directory

> attach("/home/fred/WAVELET/DISTRIB2.2/.Data")

3. You are now ready to use the software

HINTS:
    * Put the command in step 2 into a ".First" file. Then they
      will be executed every time you start up S

    * Raw S users (e.g. not Splus) may need to adapt the makefile
      (change S=Splus to S=S)

    * Users of some machines may need to adapt the makefile
      (I've had reports for IBM RS machines, DEC machines and Silicon Graphics
      machines which may help.)

DOCUMENTATION:

    * full S help documentation is supplied with the distribution

    * fuller documentation available by anonymous ftp from
      gdr.bath.ac.uk in /pub/masgpn as "dws.ps.Z". This is
      a compressed PostScript file (This is for Release 2.1).

    * The LATEST documentation for Release 2.2 may be obtained by emailing
      Guy Nason at gpn@maths.bath.ac.uk


Have fun!
