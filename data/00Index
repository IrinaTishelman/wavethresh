bwimage.colors           Sets up X11 colours to correspond to PostScript
                         image prints (wavelet).   Sets a uniform grey
                         scale for displaying images. Effectively
                         installs a colourmap for the X11 driver. There
                         are 248 gray scales ranging from white (S color
                         1) through to black (S color 248) with a uniform
                         grey scale in between. Ideally I would like 255
                         grey shades but my the X11 device does not
                         install its own colour map. I don't think the
                         other graphics devices do either, but if you
                         know different then let me know.    You can
                         change the number of grey scales by altering the
                         246 in the first character vector to something
                         else.
