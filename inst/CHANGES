4.5-1 Fixed memory leak in av_basis which is called by AvBasis.wst

4.6 Changed PsiJ. Added new option verbose, so that the information messages
	that previously were always printed out can now be suppressed.
	Also, changed default value of OPLENGTH to be 100000

    Changed wvrelease. Changed the previous two uses of "cat" to now use "message", which can be suppressed. This helps the package knitr

    Changed draw.default. Added a type argument.

    Changed nlevels to nlevelsWT. This was because nlevels clashed with
	a function of the same name in another package to do with factor
	levels.
