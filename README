12/2001: The future of this package is somewhat unclear
	 as Guy Nason has released a new version (3) of wavethresh with several
	 improvements but unfortunately not considering the many
	 consistency and documentation improvements the R porters have done
	 to this version (2.2). It is not yet clear how these will be
	 merged or ported.  -- M.Maechler
